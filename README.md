# Week2Homework
For the week 2 homework assignment i created a portfolio page that has a nav bar with three links. One to a Home/About page, one to a portfolio page, and one to a contact page.
Each page contains bootstrap classes allowing the page to be responsive throught different devices of varrying sizes. The web page contains my own personal information and links to varrying social media platforms.
